Can't find any bugs

Some things I added to my implementation however -
1. I went under the assumption that the NOT_RATED enum was for invalid rating entries. As such,  if any of those were found in loading files or input for adding a movie, they were handled as errors.
2. I set the lower-bound for movies being added as 1888. As I found online the first movie ever made was made in 1888, so no movies should come before then.
3. My MoviePlaitedList implementation for adding and deleting is ugly, but I stared at it for the longest time and couldn't find a way to get the logic to work with more private helpers.
4. My OutputFormatter recursive methods seem so repetitive, but, I suppose that's how recursion is supposed to be.
